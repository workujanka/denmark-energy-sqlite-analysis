## Results and Analysis

This section presents key findings from Denmark’s electricity production data (2005–2024), supported by SQL queries and visualized in Excel. The analysis highlights long-term trends in net energy output, shifts in power station infrastructure, the rise of renewables, offshore wind expansion, and year-over-year growth dynamics.

### Net Electricity Production (2005–2024)

Denmark’s net electricity production peaked in 2006 at over **43,000 GWh**, followed by a steady decline through the 2010s. The lowest point occurred around **2015–2016**, reflecting reduced output from central power stations and a transitional phase in energy infrastructure. From 2020 onward, production rebounded, reaching **34,710 GWh in 2024**.

This U-shaped trend suggests a shift from legacy systems toward more efficient, renewable-based generation.

### Central vs Public Power Station Share

This comparison reveals a dramatic decline in the role of **central power stations**, which dropped from **65% share in 2006** to **under 20% by 2024**. The reduction aligns with Denmark’s move away from large-scale fossil-based generation.

In contrast, **public power stations** maintained a relatively stable share around **10%**, indicating their continued role in local and distributed energy systems.

This divergence reflects a broader decentralization of energy production and a shift toward community-based and renewable sources.

### Wind and Solar Share of Net Production

Denmark’s renewable energy transformation is most evident in the rise of wind and solar:

- **Wind energy** grew from ~18% in 2005 to ~59% in 2024, becoming the dominant source of electricity.
- **Solar PV**, nearly nonexistent until 2012, rose to ~11% by 2024, with rapid growth between 2013 and 2022.

Together, wind and solar now account for **over 70%** of Denmark’s net electricity production, showcasing the success of long-term investment and policy support for renewables.

### Offshore Wind Power Growth

Offshore wind data begins in 2016, marking a new phase in Denmark’s energy strategy. Production rose from **4,650 GWh** to **9,732 GWh in 2024** — more than doubling in less than a decade.

This growth reflects:

- Strategic investment in offshore infrastructure  
- Technological advancements in turbine efficiency  
- Denmark’s geographic advantage for coastal wind harvesting  

Offshore wind is now a cornerstone of Denmark’s renewable portfolio.

### Year-over-Year Growth Rates

This analysis tracks annual percentage changes in net production, wind, and solar:

- **Net production** fluctuated, with declines in 2007, 2012, and 2015, and rebounds in 2021 and 2024.
- **Wind energy** showed consistent growth, with minor dips in 2006 and 2016.
- **Solar PV** experienced explosive growth:
  - +398% in 2013  
  - +69% in 2022  
  - Sustained double-digit growth in most years since 2012  

These growth rates highlight the dynamic nature of Denmark’s energy transition, with solar emerging as a fast-scaling contributor.
