# Denmark Electricity Production Analysis (2005–2024)

This repository contains an SQLite-based analysis of Denmark’s electricity production and consumption from **2005 to 2024**.  
The dataset (`dk_annual_energy.csv`) includes annual values for gross production, net production, central/public power stations, industrial autoproducers, wind (onshore & offshore), hydro, and solar photovoltaic.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **SQL data analysis skills** while uncovering insights into Denmark’s energy transition, especially the growth of renewable sources.
